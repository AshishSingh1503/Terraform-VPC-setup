# Terraform AWS VPC Web Setup

This project provisions a **complete AWS VPC environment** using Terraform â€” including public/private subnets, NAT gateways, a Bastion Host, a web server in a private subnet, and an Application Load Balancer to expose it to the internet.

Key Components

- **VPC** with CIDR '172.20.0.0/16'
- **4 Subnets**:
  - 2 Public (for NAT, Load Balancer, Bastion Host)
  - 2 Private (for Web Servers)
- **Internet Gateway** for public access
- **2 NAT Gateways** for private subnet outbound traffic
- **Route Tables** with correct routing for public and private subnets
- **Bastion Host** (in public subnet) for secure SSH access to private resources
- **EC2 Web Server** (in private subnet), auto-configured to serve static website content
- **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) in public subnets routing traffic to private EC2
- **Security Groups** to ensure least-privilege access
- **Key Pair Management** for secure SSH access

## Prerequisites
